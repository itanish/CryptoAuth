## What is CryptoAuth?

Eliminates need of showing physical documents as ID Proof.

Individuals have sole ownership of their digital identity.

Only necessary information about user is revealed keeping other details hidden. 

For example if verifier wants to know claimant’s age, he will scan claimant’s QR code, and without revealing actual age the claimant is verified. 

Eliminates the need to trust central entity.
